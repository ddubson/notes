[<i class='fab fa-github'></i>  Repository with Azure Pipelines setup example](https://github.com/ddubson/pal-tracker-dotnet/blob/master/azure-pipelines.yml)

1. Navigate to [Azure Pipelines Dashboard](https://dev.azure.com)
2. Log in and create a new pipeline.
3. Go to **Pipelines -> Builds -> New Build Pipeline**
4. Go through the wizard: **Connect to GitHub Yaml -> Select Repo -> ASP.NET Core Project -> Review**
5. On Review stage, refer to the Yaml below for how to approach creating a
build artifact for a .NET app

> The artifact produced is placed into `myArtifacts` directory.

Steps at a glance:

Next step is attaching the created artifact in the `Build` stage to `Releases` pipeline.

## CloudFoundry deploy

Below is an example release stage configuration, deploying to Pivotal Platform:
